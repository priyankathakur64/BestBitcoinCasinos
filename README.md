Installation

Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

• Node.js (version 14 or higher)
• Python (version 3 or higher)
• npm (comes with Node.js)
• MongoDB (if using MongoDB)

Steps to install
1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>

2. Install backend dependencies:

Navigate to the server folder and run:

bash
cd server
npm install
This will install all necessary backend dependencies including express, axios, and any other dependencies for the server.

3. Install frontend dependencies:
Navigate to the client folder and run:

bash
cd client
npm install
This will install all necessary frontend dependencies including react, axios, and other required packages.

Backend Setup
1. Ensure that the export_script.py file is in the server folder. This script will generate the reports based on the date range provided.

2. Make sure your backend is correctly configured with a MongoDB instance, if required. You can configure it by editing the .env file.

3. Run the backend server:
bash
npm start/ node app.js
The server will start on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
1. Once the backend is running, start the frontend:

bash
cd client
npm start
The frontend will be served on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Dashboard
1. Open the dashboard at http://localhost:3000.
2. The dashboard will allow you to:
   • Apply date filters to filter reports by the "From Date" and "To Date".
   • Click "Apply Filter" to fetch the data from the backend.

Download Reports
1. Once the data is filtered, the backend generates a report using the Python script (export_script.py).
2. The report is generated in JSON format and can be downloaded.

Endpoints
  • POST /api/report/export: This endpoint accepts fromDate and toDate parameters, triggers the Python script to generate the report, and returns the JSON data.

Request Body:

json
{
    "fromDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "toDate": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
Response: The response contains the generated report in JSON format.
